## Features

### Eye-Tracking and Facial Recognition
- **Focus Verification**: Use AI-powered eye-tracking and facial recognition to ensure users are focused during study sessions. Detects distractions, such as using phone, and pauses the session with a warning to refocus and continue session.

### Study Session Management
- **Session Overview**: Users provide an overview description of what they plan to study at the start of a new topic. This overview can be accessed in future sessions without re-entering the information.
- **Session Summary**: At the end of each study session, users write a brief summary of what they studied, what they learned, and their next steps (within the topic).

### Study session types
There can be multiple/personalized sessions (3x 1hr with 10 min breaks etc...)
- **Pomodoro Monitoring**: AI recommendations such as Pomodoro sessions.

### AI-Powered Summarization and Planning
- **Note Summarization**: AI summarizes user notes and PDFs into specified formats (maybe drawing board to help users explain the the format of notes/flashcard/etc...). Users can edit or delete any incorrect summaries. Note: This should be very easy i.e interface should be as simple as possible for no confusion, making the replacement of incorrect information from AI on notes/flashcards/etc... easy.
- **Goal Setting**: Users define their end goal for each study topic. The AI asks questions to understand the current state and desired outcomes, creating a personalized and easily modifiable study plan.
- **Schedule Creation**: Users specify study days and session lengths. The AI offers recommendations and sends reminders before study sessions.

### Progress Tracking
- **Progress Bar**: Visual representation of progress towards the study goal, updated based on completed tasks and milestones.

### Community and Collaboration
- **Forums**: Interaction space for users studying similar topics to share knowledge and support each other.(Once we have bigger user base)
- **Voice Interaction**: (Idea) The platform could respond to voice commands for hands-free operation (a single button would activate the listening/speaking features of the plateform)

### Rewards System
- **Goal-Based Rewards**: Users earn rewards based on the difficulty and distance to their study goals. Include actual cash rewards once the user base grows.
