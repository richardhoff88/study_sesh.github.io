## Features

### Eye-Tracking and Facial Recognition
- **Focus Verification**: Use AI-powered eye-tracking and facial recognition to ensure users are focused during study sessions. Detects distractions, such as using phone, and pauses the session with a warning to refocus and continue session.

### Study Session Management
- **Session Overview**: Users provide an overview description of what they plan to study at the start of a new topic. This overview can be accessed in future sessions without re-entering the information. New topics can be organized into different Project folders that can be accessed at later times.  Each Project will have an AI-powered timeline based on the user's preferences to meet user-specified study goals.
- **Session Summary**: When users log in, they are prompted to give a brief overview of what they are studying for a new Project.  For each project, the user will be prompted at the start of every study session about the specifics of what they plan to study in that session. At the end of each study session, users are then prompted briefly about what they studied during the session, what they learned, and their next steps (within the topic). Depending on user preferences, there can be a follow-up quiz that assesses session-specific material to ensure legitimate logging.

### Study session types
There can be multiple/personalized sessions (3x 1hr with 10 min breaks etc...)
- **Pomodoro Monitoring**: AI recommendations such as Pomodoro sessions.

### AI-Powered Summarization and Planning
- **Note Summarization**: AI summarizes user notes and PDFs into specified formats (maybe drawing board to help users explain the the format of notes/flashcard/etc...). Users can edit or delete any incorrect summaries. Note: This should be very easy i.e interface should be as simple as possible for no confusion, making the replacement of incorrect information from AI on notes/flashcards/etc... easy.
- **Goal Setting**: Users define their end goal for each study topic. The AI asks questions to understand the current state and desired outcomes, creating a personalized and easily modifiable study plan.
- **Schedule Creation**: Users specify study days and session lengths. The AI offers recommendations and sends reminders before study sessions.

### Progress Tracking
- **Progress Bar**: Visual representation of progress towards the study goal, updated based on completed tasks and milestones.

### Community and Collaboration
- **Forums**: Interaction space for users studying similar topics to share knowledge and support each other.(Once we have bigger user base)
- **Voice Interaction**: (Idea) The platform could respond to voice commands for hands-free operation (a single button would activate the listening/speaking features of the plateform)

### Rewards System
- **Goal-Based Rewards**: Users earn rewards based on the difficulty and distance to their study goals. Include actual cash rewards once the user base grows.
